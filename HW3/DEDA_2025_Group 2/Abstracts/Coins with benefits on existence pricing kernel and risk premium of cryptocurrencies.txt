Abstract:Cryptocurrencies come with benefits, such as anonymity of payments and positivenetwork effects of user adoption, and transaction risks including unconfirmedtransactions, hacks, and frauds. They compete with central-bank-regulated moneybut consumers may prefer one currency over the other. In our arbitrage-freeworld utility from consumption depends on benefits, which are governed bydistinct stochastic processes, implying incomplete markets and distinct pricingkernels. We characterize the cryptocurrency kernels, evaluate the otherwiseunobservable benefits, and show their contribution to pricing. The modelexplains both the co-existence of the two currencies and the high volatility ofthe cryptocurrency price.Keywords:Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, pricing kernel, currency competition
