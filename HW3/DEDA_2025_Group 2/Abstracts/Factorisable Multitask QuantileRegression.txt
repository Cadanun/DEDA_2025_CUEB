Abstract:A multivariate quantile regression model with a factor structure is proposed tostudy data with many responses of interest. The factor structure is allowed tovary with the quantile levels, which makes our framework more flexible than theclassical factor models. The model is estimated with the nuclear normregularization in order to accommodate the high dimensionality of data, but theincurred optimization problem can only be efficiently solved in an approximatemanner by off-the-shelf optimization methods. Such a scenario is often seen whenthe empirical risk is non-smooth or the numerical procedure involves expensivesubroutines such as singular value decompo- sition. To ensure that theapproximate estimator accurately estimates the model, non-asymptotic bounds onerror of the the approximate estimator is established. For implementation, anumerical procedure that provably marginalizes the approximate error isproposed. The merits of our model and the proposed numerical procedures aredemonstrated through Monte Carlo experiments and an application to financeinvolving a large pool of asset returns.Keywords:Factor model, quantile regression, non-asymptotic analysis, multivariateregression, nuclear norm regularization
