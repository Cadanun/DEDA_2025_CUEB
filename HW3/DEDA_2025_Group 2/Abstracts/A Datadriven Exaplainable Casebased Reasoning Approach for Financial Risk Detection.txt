Abstract:The rapid development of artificial intelligence methods contributes to theirwide applications for forecasting various financial risks in recent years. Thisstudy introduces a novel explainable case-based reasoning (CBR) approach withouta requirement of rich expertise in financial risk. Compared with other black-boxalgorithms, the explainable CBR system allows a natural economic interpretationof results. Indeed, the empirical results emphasize the interpretability of theCBR system in predicting financial risk, which is essential for both financialcompanies and their customers. In addition, results show that the proposedautomatic design CBR system has a good prediction performance compared to otherartificial intelligence methods, overcoming the main drawback of a standard CBRsystem of highly depending on prior domain knowledge about the correspondingfield.Keywords:Case-based reasoning, Financial risk detection, Multiple-criteria decision-making, Feature scoring, Particle swarm optimization, Parallel computing
