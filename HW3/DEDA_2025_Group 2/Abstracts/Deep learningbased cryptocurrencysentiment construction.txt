Abstract:We study investor sentiment on a non-classical asset, cryptocurrencies using a“cryptospecificlexicon” recently proposed in Chen et al. (2018) and statisticallearning methods.We account for context-specific information and word similarityby learning word embeddingsvia neural network-based WorVec model. On top ofpre-trained word vectors, weapply popular machine learning methods such asrecursive neural networks for sentencelevelclassification and sentiment indexconstruction. We perform this analysis on a noveldataset of 1220K messagesrelated to 425 cryptocurrencies posted on a microblogging platformStockTwitsduring the period between March 2013 and May 2018. The constructed sentimentindices are value-relevant in terms of its return and volatility predictabilityfor thecryptocurrency market index.Keywords:sentiment analysis, lexicon, social media, word embedding, deep learning
