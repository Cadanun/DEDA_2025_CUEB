Abstract:With growing economic globalization, the modern service sector is in great needof business intelligence for data analytics and computational statistics. Thejoint application of big data analytics, computational statistics and businessintelligence has great potential to make the engineering of advanced servicesystems more efficient. The purpose of this COST issue is to publish high-quality research papers (including reviews) that address the challenges ofservice data analytics with business intelligence in the face of uncertainty andrisk. High quality contributions that are not yet published or that are notunder review by other journals or peer-reviewed conferences have been collected.The resulting topic oriented special issue includes research on businessintelligence and computational statistics, data-driven financial engineering,service data analytics and algorithms for optimizing the business engineering.It also covers implementation issues of managing the service process,computational statistics for risk analysis and novel theoretical andcomputational models, data mining algorithms for risk management relatedbusiness applications.Keywords:Data Analytics, Business Intelligence Systems
