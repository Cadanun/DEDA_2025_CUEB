Abstract The recent development of private cryptocurrencies has created a need to extend existing models of private currency provision and currency competi- tion. The outcome of cryptocurrency competition should be analyzed in a model which incorporates important features of the modern cryptocurren- cies. In this paper I focus on two such features. First, cryptocurrencies operate according to a protocol - a blockchain - and are, therefore, free from the time-inconsistency problem. Second, the operation of the blockchain costs real resources. I use the Lagos-Wright search theoretic monetary model augmented with privately issued currencies as in Fernandez-Villaverde and Sanches (2016) and extend it by linear costs of private currency circulation. I show that in contrast to Fernandez-Villaverde and Sanches (2016) cryptocur- rency competition 1) does not deliver price stability and 2) puts downward pressure on the in ation in the public currency only when the costs private currency circulation (mining costs) are suciently low.
