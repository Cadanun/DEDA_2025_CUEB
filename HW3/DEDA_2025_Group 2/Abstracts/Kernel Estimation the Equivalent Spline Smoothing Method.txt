Abstract:Among nonparametric smoothers, there is a well-known correspondence betweenkernel and Fourier series methods, pivoted by the Fourier transform of thekernel. This suggests a similar relationship between kernel and splineestimators. A known special case is the result of Silverman (1984) on theeffective kernel for the classical Reinsch-Schoenberg smoothing spline in thenonparametric regression model. We present an extension by showing that a largeclass of kernel estimators have a spline equivalent, in the sense of identicalasymptotic local behaviour of the weighting coefficients. This general class ofspline smoothers includes also the minimax linear estimator over Sobolevellipsoids. The analysis is carried out for piecewise linear splines andequidistant design.Keywords:Kernel estimator, spline smoothing, filtering coefficients, differentialoperator, Green's function approximation, asymptotic minimax spline
