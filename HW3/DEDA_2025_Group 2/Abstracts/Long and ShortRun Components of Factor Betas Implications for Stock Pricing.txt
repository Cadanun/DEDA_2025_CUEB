Abstract:We propose a bivariate component GARCH-MIDAS model to estimate the long- andshort-run components of the variances and covariances. The advantage of ourmodel to the existing DCC-based models is that it uses the same form for boththe variances and covariances and that it estimates these momentssimultaneously. We apply this model to obtain long- and short-run factor betasfor industry test portfolios, where the risk factors are the market, SMB, andHML portfolios. We use these betas in cross-sectional analysis of the riskpremia. Among other things, we find that the risk premium related to the short-run market beta is significantly positive, irrespective of the choice of testportfolio. Further, the risk premia for the short-run betas of all the riskfactors are significant outside recessions.Keywords:long-run betas; short-run betas; risk premia; business cycles; component GARCHmodel; MIDAS
