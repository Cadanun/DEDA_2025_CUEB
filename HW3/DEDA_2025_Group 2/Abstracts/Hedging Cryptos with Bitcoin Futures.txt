Hedging Cryptos with Bitcoin Futures Francis LiuNatalie PackhamMeng-Jou LuWolfgang Karl Härdle Abstract:The introduction of derivatives on Bitcoin enables investors to hedge riskexposures in cryptocurrencies. Because of volatility swings and jumps incryptocurrency prices, the traditional variance-based approach to obtain hedgeratios is infeasible. As a consequence, we consider two extensions of thetraditional approach: first, different dependence structures are modelled bydifferent copulae, such as the Gaussian, Student-t, Normal Inverse Gaussian andArchimedean copulae; second, different risk measures, such as value-at-risk,expected shortfall and spectral risk measures are employed to and the optimalhedge ratio. Extensive out-of-sample tests give insights in the practice ofhedging various cryptos and crypto indices, including Bitcoin, Ethereum,Cardano, the CRIX index and a number of crypto-portfolios in the time periodDecember 2017 until May 2021. Evidences show that BTC futures can effectivelyhedge BTC and BTC-involved indices. This promising result is consistent acrossdifferent risk measures and copulae except for Frank. On the other hand, weobserve complex and diverse dependence structures between BTC-not-involvedassets and the futures. As a consequence, results of hedging other assets andindices are diverse and, in some occasions, not ideal. Keywords:Cryptocurrencies, risk management, hedging, copulas
