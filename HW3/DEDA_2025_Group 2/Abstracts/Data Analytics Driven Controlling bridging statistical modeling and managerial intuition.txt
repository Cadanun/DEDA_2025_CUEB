Abstract:Strategic planning in a corporate environment is often based on experience andintuition, although internal data is usually available and can be a valuablesource of information. Predicting merger & acquisition (M&A) events is at theheart of strategic management, yet not sufficiently motivated by dataanalytics driven controlling. One of the main obstacles in using e.g. count datatime series for M&A seems to be the fact that the intensity of M&A is timevarying at least in certain business sectors, e.g. communications. We propose anew automatic procedure to bridge this obstacle using novel statistical methods.The proposed approach allows for a selection of adaptive windows in count datasets by detecting significant changes in the intensity of events. We test theefficacy of the proposed method on a simulated count data set and put it intoaction on various M&A data sets. It is robust to aberrant behaviour andgenerates accurate forecasts for the evaluated business sectors. It alsoprovides guidance for an a-priori selection of  fixed windows for forecasting.Furthermore, it can be generalized to other business lines, e.g. for managingsupply chains, sales forecasts, or call center arrivals, thus giving managersnew ways for incorporating statistical modeling in strategic planning decisions.Keywords:-
