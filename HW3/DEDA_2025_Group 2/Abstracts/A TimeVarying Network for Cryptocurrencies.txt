Abstract:Cryptocurrencies return cross-predictability and technological similarity yieldinformation on risk propagation and market segmentation. To investigate theseeffects, we build a time-varying network for cryptocurrencies, based on theevolution of return cross-predictability and technological similarities. Wedevelop a dynamic covariate-assisted spectral clustering method to consistentlyestimate the latent community structure of cryptocurrencies network thataccounts for both sets of information. We demonstrate that investors can achievebetter risk diversification by investing in cryptocurrencies from differentcommunities. A cross-sectional portfolio that implements an inter-cryptomomentum trading strategy earns a 1.08% daily return. By dissecting theportfolio returns on behavioral factors, we conâ€€rm that our results are notdriven by behavioral mechanisms.Keywords:Community detection, Dynamic stochastic blockmodel, Covariates, Co-clustering,Network risk, Momentum
