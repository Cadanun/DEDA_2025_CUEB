Abstract:Deep learning has substantially advanced the state-of-the-art in computervision, natural language processing and other  elds. The paper examines thepotential of contemporary recurrent deep learning architectures for  nancialtime series forecasting. Considering the foreign exchange market as testbed, wesystematically compare long short-term memory networks and gated recurrent unitsto traditional recurrent architectures as well as feedforward networks in termsof their directional forecasting accuracy and the profitability of trading modelpredictions. Empirical results indicate the suitability of deep networks forexchange rate forecasting in general but also evidence the diculty ofimplementing and tuning corresponding architectures. Especially with regard totrading pro t, a simpler neural network may perform as well as if not betterthan a more complex deep neural network.Keywords:Deep learning, Financial time series forecasting, Recurrent neural networks,Foreign exchange rates
