Abstract:The CRIX (CRyptocurrency IndeX) has been constructed based on approximately 30 cryptos and captures high coverage of available market capitalisation. The CRIX index family covers a range of cryptos based on different liquidity rules and various model selection criteria. Details of ECRIX (Exact CRIX), EFCRIX (Exact Full CRIX) and also intraday CRIX movements may be found on the webpage of hu.berlin/crix. In order to price contingent claims one needs to first understand the dynamics of these indices. Here we provide a first econometric analysis of the CRIX family within a time-series framework. The key steps of our analysis include model selection, estimation and testing. Linear dependence is removed by an ARIMA model, the diagnostic checking resulted in an ARIMA(2,0,2) model for the available sample period from Aug 1st, 2014 to April 6th, 2016. The model residuals showed the well known phenomenon of volatility clustering. Therefore a further refinement lead us to an ARIMA(2,0,2)-t-GARCH(1,1) process. This specification conveniently takes care of fat-tail properties that are typical for financial markets. The multivariate GARCH models are implemented on the CRIX index family to explore the interaction.Keywords:
