Abstract:Cryptocurrencies are gaining momentum in investor attention, are about to becomea new asset class, and may provide a hedging alternative against the risk ofdevaluation of fiat currencies following the COVID-19 crisis. In order toprovide a thorough understanding of this new asset class, risk indicators needto consider tail risk behaviour and the interdependencies between thecryptocurrencies not only for risk management but also for portfoliooptimization. The tail risk network analysis framework proposed in the paper isable to identify individual risk characteristics and capture spillover effect ina network topology. Finally we construct tail event sensitive portfolios andconsequently test the performance during an unforeseen COVID-19 pandemic.Keywords:Cryptocurrencies, Network Dynamics, Portfolio Optimization, Quantile Regression,Systemic Risk, Financial Risk Meter
