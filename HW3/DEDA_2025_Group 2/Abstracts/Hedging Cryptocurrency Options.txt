Hedging Cryptocurrency Options Jovanka MaticNatalie PackhamWolfgang Karl Härdle Abstract:The cryptocurrency (CC) market is volatile, non-stationary and noncontinuous.Together with liquid derivatives markets, this poses a unique opportunity tostudy risk management, especially the hedging of options, in a turbulent market.We study the hedge behaviour and effectiveness for the class of a ne jumpdiffusion models and infinite activity Lévy processes. First, market data iscalibrated to SVI-implied volatility surfaces to price options. To cover a widerange of market dynamics, we generate Monte Carlo price paths using an SVCJmodel (stochastic volatility with correlated jumps) assumption and a close-to-actual-market GARCH- filtered kernel density estimation. In these two markets,options are dynamically hedged with Delta, Delta-Gamma, Delta-Vega and MinimumVariance strategies. Including a wide range of market models allows tounderstand the trade-off in the hedge performance between complete, but overlyparsimonious models, and more complex, but incomplete models. The calibrationresults reveal a strong indication for stochastic volatility, low jump frequencyand evidence of infinite activity. Short-dated options are less sensitive tovolatility or Gamma hedges. For longer-date options, good tail risk reduction isconsistently achieved with multiple-instrument hedges. This is persistentlyaccomplished with complete market models with stochastic volatility.
