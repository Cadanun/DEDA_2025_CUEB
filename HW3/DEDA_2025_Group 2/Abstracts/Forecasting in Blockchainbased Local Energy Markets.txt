Abstract:Increasingly volatile and distributed energy production challenge traditionalmechanisms to manage grid loads and price energy. Local energy markets (LEMs)may be a response to those challenges as they can balance energy production andconsumption locally and may lower energy costs for consumers. Blockchain-basedLEMs provide a decentralized market to local energy consumer and prosumers. Theyimplement a market mechanism in the form of a smart contract without the needfor a central authority coordinating the market. Recently proposed blockchain-based LEMs use auction designs to match future demand and supply. Thus, suchblockchain-based LEMs rely on accurate short-term forecasts of individualhouseholdsâ€™ energy consumption and production. Often, such accurate forecastsare simply assumed to be given. The present research tests this assumption.First, by evaluating the forecast accuracy achievable with state-of-the-artenergy forecasting techniques for individual households and, second, byassessing the effect of prediction errors on market outcomes in three differentsupply scenarios. The evaluation shows that, although a LASSO regression modelis capable of achieving reasonably low forecasting errors, the costly settlementof prediction errors can offset and even surpass the savings brought toconsumers by a blockchain-based LEM. This shows, that due to prediction errors,participation in LEMs may be uneconomical for consumers, and thus, has to betaken into consideration for pricing mechanisms in blockchain-based LEMs.Keywords:Blockchain; Local Energy Market; Smart Contract; Machine Learning; Household;Energy Prediction; Prediction Errors; Market Mechanism
