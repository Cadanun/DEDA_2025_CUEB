Abstract:The 2017 bubble on the cryptocurrency market recalls our memory in the dot-combubble, during which hard-to-measure fundamentals and investorsâ€™ illusion forbrand new technologies led to overvalued prices. Benefiting from the massiveincrease in the volume of messages published on social media and message boards,we examine the impact of investor sentiment, conditional on bubble regimes, oncryptocurrencies aggregate return prediction. Constructing a crypto-specificlexicon and using a local-momentum autoregression model, we find that thesentiment effect is prolonged and sustained during the bubble while it turns outa reversal effect once the bubble collapsed. The out-of-sample analysis alongwith portfolio analysis is conducted in this study. When measuring investorsentiment for a new type of asset such as cryptocurrencies, we highlight thatthe impact of investor sentiment on cryptocurrency returns is conditional onbubble regimes.Keywords:Cryptocurrency; Sentiment; Bubble; Return Predictability
