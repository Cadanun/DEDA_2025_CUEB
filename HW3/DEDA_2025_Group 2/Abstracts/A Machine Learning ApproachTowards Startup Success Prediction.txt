Abstract:The importance of startups for a dynamic, innovative and competitive economy hasalready been acknowledged in the scientific and business literature. The highlyuncertain and volatile nature of the startup ecosystem makes the evaluation ofstartup success through analysis and interpretation of information very timeconsuming and computationally intensive. This prediction problem brings forwardthe need for a quantitative model, which should enable an objective and fact-based approach to startup success prediction. This paper presents a series ofreproducible models for startup success prediction, using machine learningmethods. The data used for this purpose was received from the online investorplatform, crunchbase.com. The data has been pre-processed for sampling bias andimbalance by using the oversampling approach, ADASYN. A total of six differentmodels are implemented to predict startup success. Using goodness-of-fitmeasures, applicable to each model case, the best models selected are theensemble methods, random forest and extreme gradient boosting with a test setprediction accuracy of 94.1% and 94.5% and AUC of 92.22% and 92.91%respectively. Top variables in these models are last funding to date, firstfunding lag and company age. The models presented in this study can be used topredict success rate for future new firms/ventures in a repeatable way.Keywords:Machine learning
