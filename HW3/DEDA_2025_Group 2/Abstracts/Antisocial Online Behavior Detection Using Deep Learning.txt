Abstract:The shift of human communication to online platforms brings many benefits tosociety due to the ease of publication of opinions, sharing experience, gettingimmediate feedback and the opportunity to discuss the hottest topics. Besidesthat, it builds up a space for antisocial behavior such as harassment, insultand hate speech. This research is dedicated to detection of antisocial onlinebehavior detection (AOB) - an umbrella term for cyberbullying, hate speech,cyberaggression and use of any hateful textual content. First, we provide abenchmark of deep learning models found in the literature on AOB detection. Deeplearning has already proved to be efficient in different types of decisionsupport: decision support from financial disclosures, predicting processbehavior, text-based emoticon recognition. We compare methods of traditionalmachine learning with deep learning, while applying important advancements ofnatural language processing: we examine bidirectional encoding, compareattention mechanisms with simpler reduction techniques, and investigate whetherthe hierarchical representation of the data and application of attention ondifferent layers might improve the predictive performance. As a partialcontribution of the final hierarchical part, we introduce pseudo-sentencehierarchical attention network, an extension of hierarchical attention network â€“a recent advancement in document classification.Keywords:Deep Learning, Cyberbullying, Antisocial Online Behavior, Attention Mechanism,Text Classification
