Abstract:Many countries have taken non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain thespread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and push the recovery of nationaleconomies. This paper investigates the effect of these control measures bycomparing five selected countries, China, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom,and the United States. There is evidence that the degree of early interventionand efficacy of control measures are essential to contain the pandemic. Chinastands out because its early and strictly enforced interventions are effectiveto contain the virus spread. Furthermore, we quantify the causal effect ofdifferent control measures on COVID-19 transmission and work resumption inChina. Surprisingly, digital contact tracing and delegating clear responsibilityto the local community appear to be the two most effective policy measures fordisease containment and work resumption. Public information campaigns and socialdistancing also help to flatten the peak significantly. Moreover, materiallogistics that prevent medical supply shortages provide an additionalconditioning factor for disease containment and work resumption. Fiscal policy,however, is less effective at the early to middle stage of the pandemic.Keywords:COVID-19, coronavirus
