Abstract:The proportional subdistribution hazards (PSH) model is popularly used to dealwith competing risks data. Censored quantile regression provides an importantsupplement as well as variable selection methods, due to large numbers ofirrelevant covariates in practice. In this paper, we study variable selectionprocedures based on penalized weighted quantile regression for competing risksmodels, which is conveniently applied by researchers. Asymptotic properties ofthe proposed estimators including consistency and asymptotic normality of non-penalized estimator and consistency of variable selection are established. MonteCarlo simulation studies are conducted, showing that the proposed methods areconsiderably stable and efficient. A real data about bone marrow transplant(BMT) is also analyzed to illustrate the application of proposed procedure.Keywords:Competing risks, Cumulative incidence function, Kaplan-Meier estimator,Redistribution method
