Abstract:We distill tone from a huge assortment of NASDAQ articles to examine thepredictive power of media-expressed tone in single-stock option markets andequity markets. We find that (1) option markets are impacted by media tone; (2)option variables predict stock returns along with tone; (3) option variablesorthogonalized to public information and tone are more effective predictors ofstock returns; (4) overnight tone appears to be more informative than trading-time tone, possibly due to a different thematic coverage of the trading versusthe overnight archive; (5) tone disagreement commands a strong positive riskpremium above and beyond market volatility.Keywords:option markets, equity markets, stock return predictability, media tone, topicmodel
