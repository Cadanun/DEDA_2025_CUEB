Abstract:This paper provides a detailed framework for modeling portfolios, achieving thehighest growth rate under subjective risk constraints such as Value at Risk(VaR) in the presence of stable laws. Although the maximization of the expectedlogarithm of wealth induces outperforming any other significantly differentstrategy, the Kelly Criterion implies larger bets than a risk-averse investorwould accept. Restricting the Kelly optimization by spectral risk measures, theauthors provide a generalized mapping for different measures of growth andsecurity. Analyzing over 30 years of S&P 500 returns for different samplingfrequencies, the authors find evidence for leptokurtic behavior for allrespective sampling frequencies. Given that lower sampling frequencies imply asmaller number of data points, this paper argues in favor of Î±-stable laws andits scaling behavior to model financial market returns for a given horizon in ani.i.d. world. Instead of simulating from the class of elliptically stabledistributions, a nonparametric scaling approximation, based on the data-setitself, is proposed. Our paper also uncovers that including long put optionsinto the portfolio optimization, improves the growth criterion for a givensecurity level, leading to a new Kelly portfolio providing the highest geometricmean.Keywords:growth-optimal, Kelly criterion, protective put, portfolio optimization, stabledistribution, Value at Risk
