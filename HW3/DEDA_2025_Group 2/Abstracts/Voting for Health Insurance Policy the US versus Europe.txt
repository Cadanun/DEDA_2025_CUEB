Abstract:In this paper, we build an overlapping generation model to examine the reasonwhy developed countries with similar background have implemented differentsocial health insurance systems. We propose two hypotheses to explain thisphenomenon: (i) the different participation rates of the poor in the voting;(ii) the distinct attitudes towards the size of the government and the existenceof a compulsory social health insurance system. Agents need to vote for one oftwo policies: Policy I without Social Health Insurance (SHI) but with thesubsidy for the poor, and Policy II with fully covered SHI. By comparing eithertheir current utility or the expected life time utility, households will chooseone policy. We find that under Policy I, the derivative of the changes ofexpected utility with respect to income is not monotonic. This means that boththe poorest and the richest dislike the social health insurance system. With thecalibrated parameters, we solve the benchmark and find that the publicâ€™sattitude towards the size of the government and the lower representation of thepoor affect the election result. The changes in the minimum consumption levelunder Policy I affect the voting results most, followed by the attitude. VotingParticipant rate plays the most insignificant role in the voting outcome. Thesensitivity analysis shows that our main findings are robust to the inputparameters.Keywords:Social Health Insurance, Voting
