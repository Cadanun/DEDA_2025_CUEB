Abstract:Weekly, quarterly and yearly risk measures are crucial for risk reportingaccording to Basel III and Solvency II. For the respective data frequencies, theauthors show in a simulation and backtest study that available data series arenot sufficient in order to estimate Value at Risk and Expected Shortfallsufficiently, given confidence levels of 99.9% and 99.99%. Accordingly, thispaper presents a semi-parametric estimation method, rescaling data from high- tolow-frequency which allows to obtain significantly more data points for theestimation of the respective risk measures. The presented methodology in theÎ±-stable framework, which is able to mimic multifractal behavior in assetreturns, provides tail events which never occurred in the original low-frequencydataset.Keywords:high-frequency, multifractal, stable distribution, rescaling, risk management,Value at Risk, quantile distribution
