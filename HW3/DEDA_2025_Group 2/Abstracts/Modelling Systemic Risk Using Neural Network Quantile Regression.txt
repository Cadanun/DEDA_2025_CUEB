Abstract:We propose an approach to calibrate the conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) offinancial institutions based on neural network quantile regression. Building onthe estimation results we model systemic risk spillover effects across banks byconsidering the marginal effects of the quantile regression procedure. We adopt adropout regularization procedure to remedy the well-known issue of overfittingfor neural networks, and we provide empirical evidence for the favorable out-of-sample performance of a regularized neural network. We then propose threemeasures for systemic risk from our fitted results. We find that systemic riskincreases sharply during the height of the financial crisis in 2008 and againafter a short period of easing in 2011 and 2015. Our approach also allowsidentifying systemically relevant firms during the financial crisis.Keywords:Systemic risk, CoVaR, Quantile regression, Neural networks
