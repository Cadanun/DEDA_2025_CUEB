Abstract:We develop a general approach for stress testing correlations of financial assetportfolios. The correlation matrix of asset returns is specified in a parametricform, where correlations are represented as a function of risk factors, such ascountry and industry factors. A sparse factor structure linking assets and riskfactors is built using Bayesian variable selection methods. Regular calibrationyields a joint distribution of economically meaningful stress scenarios of thefactors. As such, the method also lends itself as a reverse stress testingframework: using the Mahalanobis distance or highest density regions (HDR) onthe joint risk factor distribution allows to infer worst-case correlationscenarios. We give examples of stress tests on a large portfolio of European andNorth American stocks.Keywords:Correlation stress testing, reverse stress testing, factor selection, scenarioselection, Bayesian variable selection, market risk management
