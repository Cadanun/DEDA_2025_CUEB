Abstract:The paper presents a systematic theory for asymptotic inferences based onautocovariances of stationary processes. We consider nonparametric tests for serial correlations using the maximum and the quadratic deviations of sampleautocovariances. For these cases, with proper centering and rescaling, theasymptotic distributions of the deviations are Gumbel and Gaussian, respectively. To establish such an asymptotic theory, as byproducts, we develop anormal comparison principle and propose a sufficient condition for summabilityof joint cumulants of stationary processes. We adapt a blocks of blocksbootstrapping procedure proposed by Kuensch (1989) and Liu and Singh (1992) tothe maximum deviation based tests to improve the finite-sample performance.Keywords:Autocovariance, blocks of blocks bootstrapping, Box-Pierce test, extreme valuedistribution, moderate deviation, normal comparison, physical dependencemeasure, short range dependence, stationary process, summability of cumulants
