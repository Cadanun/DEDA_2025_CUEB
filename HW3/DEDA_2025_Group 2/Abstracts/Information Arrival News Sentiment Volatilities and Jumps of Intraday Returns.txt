Abstract:This work aims to investigate the (inter)relations of information arrival, newssentiment, volatilities and jump dynamics of intraday returns. Two parametricGARCH-type jump models which explicitly incorporate both news arrival and newssentiment variables are proposed, among which one assumes news affectingfinancial markets through the jump component while the other postulating theGARCH component channel. In order to give the most-likely format of theinteractions between news arrival and stock market behaviors, these two modelsare compared with several other easier versions of GARCH-type models based onthe calibration results on DJIA 30 stocks. The necessity to include newsprocesses in intraday stock volatility modeling is justified in our specificcalibration samples (2008 and 2013, respectively). While it is not as profitableto model jump process separately as using simpler GARCH process with errordistribution capable to capture fat tail behaviors of financial time series. Inconclusion, our calibration results suggest GARCH-news model with skew-tinnovation distribution as the best candidate for intraday returns of largestocks in US market, which means one can probably avoid the complicatedness ofmodelling jump behavior by using a simplier skew-t error distribution assumptioninstead, but itâ€™s necessary to incorporate news variables.Keywords:information arrival, volatility modeling, jump, sentiment, GARCH
