Abstract:This paper surveys the capacity of simple macroeconomic models — ”three easypieces” — to account for persistent and positive valuations of privately issuedassets based on the blockchain. Each of these three models — transactions demandfor a means of payment, consumption-based capital asset pricing, and search andmatching — highlights important aspects of digital payments. The mutualinterference of these jointly produced features may impede widespread use ofcryptocurrencies until technological innovations have been developed to separatethem.
