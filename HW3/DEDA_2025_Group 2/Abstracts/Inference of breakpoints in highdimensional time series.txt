Abstract:We consider a new procedure for detecting structural breaks in mean for high-dimensional time series. We target breaks happening at unknown time points andlocations. In particular, at a fixed time point our method is concerned witheither the biggest break in one location or aggregating simultaneous breaks overmultiple locations. We allow for both big or small sized breaks, so that we ca), stamp the dates and the locations of the breaks, 2), estimate the breaksizes and 3), make inference on the break sizes as well as the break dates. Ourtheoretical setup incorporates both temporal and crosssectional dependence, andis suitable for heavy-tailed innovations. We derive the asymptotic distributionfor the sizes of the breaks by extending the existing powerful theory on locallinear kernel estimation and high dimensional Gaussian approximation to allowfor trend stationary time series with jumps. A robust long-run covariance matrixestimation is proposed, which can be of independent interest. An application ondetecting structural changes of the US unemployment rate is considered toillustrate the usefulness of our method.Keywords:high-dimensional time series, multiple change-points, Gaussian approximation,nonparametric estimation, heavy tailed, long-run covariance matrix
