Abstract:In this paper, we conduct simultaneous inference of the non-parametric part of apartially linear model when the non-parametric component is a multivariateunknown function. Based on semi-parametric estimates of the model, we constructa simultaneous confidence region of the multivariate function for simultaneousinference. The developed methodology is applied to perform simultaneousinference for the U.S. gasoline demand where the income and price variables arecontaminated by Berkson errors. The empirical results strongly suggest that thelinearity of the U.S. gasoline demand is rejected. The results are also used topropose an alternative form for the demand.Keywords:Simultaneous inference, Multivariate function, Simultaneous confidence region,Berkson error, Regression calibration
