Abstract:This paper provides statistical learning techniques for determining the fullown-price market impact and the relevance and effect of cross-price and cross-asset spillover channels from intraday transactions data. The novel tools allowextracting comprehensive information contained in the limit order books (LOB)and quantify their impacts on the size and structure of price interdependenciesacross stocks. For correct empirical network determination of such dynamicliquidity price eâ€€ects even in small portfolios, we require high-dimensionalstatistical learning methods with an integrated general bootstrap procedure. Wedocument the importance of LOB liquidity network spillovers even for a smallblue-chip NASDAQ portfolio.Keywords:limit order book, high-dimensional statistical learning, liquidity networks,high frequency dynamics, market impact, bootstrap, network
