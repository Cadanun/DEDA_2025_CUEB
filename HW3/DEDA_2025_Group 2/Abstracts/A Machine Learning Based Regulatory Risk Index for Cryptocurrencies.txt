Abstract:Cryptocurrenciesâ€™ values often respond aggressively to major policy changes, butnone of the existing indices informs on the market risks associated withregulatory changes. In this paper, we quantify the risks originating from newregulations on FinTech and cryptocurrencies (CCs), and analyse their impact onmarket dynamics. Specifically, a Cryptocurrency Regulatory Risk IndeX (CRRIX) isconstructed based on policy-related news coverage frequency. The unlabeled newsdata are collected from the top online CC news platforms and further classifiedusing a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model and Hellinger distance. Our resultsshow that the machine-learning-based CRRIX successfully captures major policy-changing moments. The movements for both the VCRIX, a market volatility index,and the CRRIX are synchronous, meaning that the CRRIX could be helpful for allparticipants in the cryptocurrency market. The algorithms and Python code areavailable for research purposes on www.quantlet.de.Keywords:Cryptocurrency, Regulatory Risk, Index, LDA, News Classification
