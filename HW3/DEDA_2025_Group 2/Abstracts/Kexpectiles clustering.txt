Abstract:K-means clustering is one of the most widely-used partitioning algorithm incluster analysis due to its simplicity and computational efficiency, but it maynot provide ideal clustering results when applying to data with non-sphericallyshaped clusters. By considering the asymmetrically weighted distance, We proposethe K-expectile clustering and search the clusters via a greedy algorithm thatminimizes the within cluster τ-variance. We provide algorithms based on twoschemes: the fixed τ clustering, and the adaptive τ clustering. Validated bysimulation results, our method has enhanced performance on data with asymmetricshaped clusters or clusters with a complicated structure. Applications of ourmethod show that the fixed τ clustering can bring some flexibility onsegmentation with a decent accuracy, while the adaptive τ clustering may yieldbetter performance.
