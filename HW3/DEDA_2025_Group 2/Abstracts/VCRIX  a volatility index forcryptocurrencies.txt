Abstract:Public interest, explosive returns, and diversification opportunities gavestimulus to the adoption of traditional financial tools to crypto-currencies.While the CRIX index offered the first scientifically-backed proxy to thecrypto- market (analogous to S&P 500), the introduction of Bitcoin futures byCboe became the milestone in the creation of the derivatives market for crypto-currencies. Following the intuition of the "fear index" VIX for the Americanstock market, the VCRIX volatility index was created to capture the investorexpectations about the crypto-currency ecosystem. VCRIX is built based on CRIXand offers a forecast for the mean annualized volatility of the next 30 days,re-estimated daily. The model was back-tested for its forecasting power,resulting in low MSE performance and further examined by the simulation of VIX(resulting in a correlation of 78% between the actual VIX and VIX estimated withthe VCRIX model). VCRIX provides forecasting functionality and serves as a proxyfor the investorsâ€™ expectations in the absence of the de- veloped derivativesmarket. These features provide enhanced decision making capacities for marketmonitoring, trading strategies, and potentially option pricing.Keywords:index construction, volatility, crypto-currency, VCRIX
