Abstract:This study seeks to evaluate the effect of green financial development,improving energy efficiency and economic growth on Covid-19 tenure. For this,the CPEC area is recommended to look into. Present study revealed the energyeconomic negative repercussions of Covid-19 impacts. It is assumed that, inChina and Pakistan, economic expansion, trade openness, financial development,and urbanization coexist. To verify the postulated impacts of economic activityon the environment, we do Johansen cointegration, error correction, and Grangercausality tests. We discovered that economic growth, energy consumption, tradeopenness, financial development, and urbanization had a long-term relationshipto C emissions in Pakistan. Urbanization is the only macroeconomic factor witha detrimental effect on carbon emissions. As with China, no cointegration isfound across variables, but unidirectional causality from energy consumption andeconomic growth to economic growth is established. Economic growth, energyconsumption, and trade openness also each have bidirectional causal effect onfinancial development. According to statistical data, along with significantprojected economic development in CPEC countries, policymakers and regulatorsare urged to strengthen environmental protection laws in China and Pakistan.Keywords:Green financial development, Energy Financing, Energy Efficiency, Economicgrowth, Covid-19 crises, Capital formation
