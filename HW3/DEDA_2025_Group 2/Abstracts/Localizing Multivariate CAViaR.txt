Abstract:The risk transmission among financial markets is time-evolving, especially forthe extreme risk scenarios. The possibly sudden time variations of these riskstructures ask for quantitative technology that is able to cope with suchsituations. Here we present a novel localized multivariate CAViaR-type model torespond to the challenge of time-varying risk contagion. For this purpose alocal adaptive approach determines homogeneous intervals at each time point.Critical values for this technique are calculated via multiplier bootstrap, andthe statistical properties of this ”localized multivariate CAViaR” are derived.A comprehensive simulation study supports the effectiveness of our approach indetecting structural change in multivariate CAViaR. Finally, when applying forthe US and German financial markets, we can trace out the dynamic tail riskspillovers and find that the US market appears to play dominate role in risktransmissions, especially in volatile market periods.Keywords:conditional quantile autoregression, local parametric approach, change pointdetection, multiplier bootstrap
