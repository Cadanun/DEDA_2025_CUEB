Abstract:Second-hand car markets contribute to billions of Euro turnover each year buthardly generate profit for used car dealers. The paper examines the potential ofsophisticated data-driven pricing systems to enhance supplier-side decision-making and escape the zero-profit-trap. Profit maximization requires an accurateunderstanding of demand. The paper identifies factors that characterize consumerdemand and proposes a framework to estimate demand functions using survivalanalysis. Empirical analysis of a large data set of daily used car sales betwee08 to 2012 confirm the merit of the new factors. Observed results also showthe value of survival analysis to explain and predict demand. Random survivalforest emerges as the most suitable vehicle to develop price response functionsas input for a dynamic pricing system.Keywords:Automotive Industry, Price Optimization, Survival Analysis, Dynamic Pricing
