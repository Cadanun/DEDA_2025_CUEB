Abstract:Short Term Load Forecast (STLF) is necessary for effective scheduling, operationoptimization trading, and decision-making for electricity consumers. Modern andefficient machine learning methods are recalled nowadays to manage complicatedstructural big datasets, which are characterized by having a nonlinear temporaldependence structure. We propose different statistical nonlinear models tomanage these challenges of hard type datasets and forecast 15-min frequencyelectricity load up to 2-days ahead. We show that the Long-short Term Memory(LSTM) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models applied to the production lineof a chemical production facility outperform several other predictive models interms of out-of-sample forecasting accuracy by the Diebold-Mariano (DM) testwith several metrics.  The predictive information is fundamental for the riskand production management of electricity consumers.Keywords:Short Term Load Forecast, Deep Neural Network, Hard Structure Load Process
