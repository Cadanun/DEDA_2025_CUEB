Abstract:Housing typically takes up a major proportion of households' expenditure, andthus it certainly plays a critical role in shaping the pattern of income in-equality and social mobility. Whether high housing price-to-rent ratio will am-plify inequality and inhibit social class upgrading is still a controversialissue in the existing literature. In this paper, we develop a partialequilibrium life- cycle framework to address these issues. Agents in our economyare divided into two social classes according to the initial human capital levelinherited from their parents. Those who belong to upper class will draw theirinnate abilities from a distribution that  rst order stochastically dominatesthose from lower class. Throughout the entire lifecycle, agents make endogenoushuman capital investment and housing tenure decisions. We calibrate the model tomimic some stylized facts in the the real world counter part. Our simulationresults indicate an inverse-U pattern between housing price-to-rent ratio andmeasures of income inequality, and as well as a U-shape pattern between price-to-rent ratio and social mobility measured by Shorrocks Index. The implicationis that housing tends to amplify the inequality and slow down the socialmobility when houses can only be purchased by a small group of agents in theeconomy. Moreover, our results also suggest that better quality of education asa result of a higher return to human capital investment tends to dampen the roleof housing.Keywords:Income Inequality, Social Mobility, Price-to-rent ratio
