Abstract:Penalized spline smoothing of time series and its asymptotic properties arestudied. A data-driven algorithm for selecting the smoothing parameter isdeveloped. The proposal is applied to define a semiparametric extension of thewell-known Spline- GARCH, called a P-Spline-GARCH, based on the log-datatransformation of the squared returns. It is shown that now the errors processis exponentially strong mixing with finite moments of all orders. Asymptoticnormality of the P-spline smoother in this context is proved. Practicalrelevance of the proposal is illustrated by data examples and simulation. Theproposal is further applied to value at risk and expected shortfall.Keywords:P-spline smoother, smoothing parameter selection, P-Spline-GARCH, strong mixing,value at risk, expected shortfall
