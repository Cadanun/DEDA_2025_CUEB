Abstract:Several cryptocurrency (CC) indices track the dynamics of the rising CC sector,and soon ETFs will be issued on them. We conduct a qualitative and quantitativeevaluation of the currently existing CC indices. As the CC sector is not yetconsolidated, index issuers face the challenge of tracking the dynamics of afast-growing sector that is under continuous transformation. We propose severalcriteria and various measures to compare the indices under review. Majordifferences between the indices lie in their weighting schemes, their coverageof CCs and the number of constituents, the level of transparency, and thus theiraccuracy in mapping the dynamics of the CC sector. Our analysis reveals thatindices that adapt dynamically to this rising sector outperform theircompetitors. Interestingly, increasing the number of constituents does notautomatically lead to a better fit of the CC sector.
