Abstract:We investigate the relationship between underlying blockchain mechanism ofcryptocurrencies and its distributional characteristics. In addition to price,we emphasise on using actual block size and block time as the operationalfeatures of cryptos. We use distributional characteristics such as fourier powerspectrum, moments, quantiles, global we optimums, as well as the measures forlong term dependencies, risk and noise to summarise the information from cryptotime series. With the hypothesis that the blockchain structure explains thedistributional characteristics of cryptos, we use characteristic based spectralclustering to cluster the selected cryptos into  five groups. We scrutinisethese clusters and  find that indeed, the clusters of cryptos share similarmechanism such as origin of fork, difficulty adjustment frequency, and thenature of block size. This paper provides crypto creators and users with abetter understanding toward the connection between the blockchain protocoldesign and distributional characteristics of cryptos.Keywords:Cryptocurrency, price, blockchain mechanism, distributional characteristics,clustering
