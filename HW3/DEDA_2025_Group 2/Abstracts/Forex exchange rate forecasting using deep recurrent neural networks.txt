Abstract:Deep learning has substantially advanced the state of the art in computervision, natural language processing, and other fields. The paper examines thepotential of deep learning for exchange rate forecasting. We systematicallycompare long short- term memory networks and gated recurrent units totraditional recurrent network architectures as well as feedforward networks interms of their directional forecasting accuracy and the profitability of tradingmodel predictions. Empirical results indicate the suitability of deep networksfor exchange rate forecasting in general but also evidence the difficulty ofimplementing and tuning corresponding architectures. Especially with regard totrading profit, a simpler neural network may perform as well as if not betterthan a more complex deep neural network.Keywords:Deep learning, Financial time series forecasting, Recurrent neural networks,Foreign exchange rates
