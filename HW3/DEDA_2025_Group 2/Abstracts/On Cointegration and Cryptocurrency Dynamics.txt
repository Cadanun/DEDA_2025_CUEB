Abstract:This paper aims to model the joint dynamics of cryptocurrencies in anonstationary setting. In particular, we analyze the role of cointegrationrelationships within a large system of cryptocurrencies in a vector errorcorrection model (VECM) framework. To enable analysis in a dynamic setting, wepropose the COINtensity VECM, a nonlinear VECM specification accounting for avarying systemwide cointegration exposure. Our results show thatcryptocurrencies are indeed cointegrated with a cointegration rank of four. Wealso find that all currencies are affected by these long term equilibriumrelations. A simple statistical arbitrage trading strategy is proposed showing agreat in-sample performance.Keywords:Cointegration, VECM, Nonstationarity, Cryptocurrencies
