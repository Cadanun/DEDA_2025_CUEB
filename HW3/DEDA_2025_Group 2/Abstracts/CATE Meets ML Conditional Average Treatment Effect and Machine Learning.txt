Abstract:For treatment effects - one of the core issues in modern econometric analysis -prediction and estimation are flip-sides of the same coin. As it turns out,machine learning methods are the tool for generalized prediction models.Combined with econometric theory allows us to estimate not only the average buta personalized treatment effect - the conditional average treatment effect(CATE). In this tutorial, we give an overview of novel methods, explain them indetail, and apply them via Quantlets in real data applications. We study theeffect that microcredit availability has on the amount of money borrowed and ifthe 401(k) pension plan eligibility has an impact on net financial assets, astwo empirical examples. The presented toolbox of methods contains meta-learners, like the Doubly-Robust, the R-, T- and X-learner, and methods that arespecially designed to estimate the CATE like the causal BART and the generalizedrandom forest. In both, the microcredit and the 401(k) example, we find apositive treatment effect for all observations but diverse evidence of treatmenteffect heterogeneity. An additional simulation study, where the true treatmenteffect is known, allows us to compare the different methods and to observepatterns and similarities.Keywords:Causal Inference, CATE, Machine Learning, Tutorial
