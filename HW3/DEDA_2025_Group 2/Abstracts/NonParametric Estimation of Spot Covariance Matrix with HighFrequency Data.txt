Abstract:Estimating spot covariance is an important issue to study, especially with theincreasing availability of high-frequency  nancial data. We study the estimationof spot covariance using a kernel method for high-frequency data. In particular,we consider  rst the kernel weighted version of realized covariance estimatorfor the price process governed by a continuous multivariate semimartingale.Next, we extend it to the threshold kernel estimator of the spot covarianceswhen the underlying price process is a discontinuous multivariate semimartingalewith  nite activity jumps. We derive the asymptotic distribution of theestimators for both  xed and shrinking bandwidth. The estimator in a settingwith jumps has the same rate of convergence as the estimator for di usionprocesses without jumps. A simulation study examines the  nite sample propertiesof the estimators. In addition, we study an application of the estimator in thecontext of covariance forecasting. We discover that the forecasting model withour estimator outperforms a benchmark model in the literature.Keywords:high-frequency data; kernel estimation; jump; forecasting covariance matrix
