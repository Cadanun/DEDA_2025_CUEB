Abstract:This paper proposes a dynamic spatial autoregressive quantile model. Usingpredetermined network information, we study dynamic tail event driven risk usinga system of conditional quantile equations. Extending Zhu, Wang, Wang and Härdle(2019), we allow the contemporaneous dependency of nodal responses byincorporating a spatial lag in our model. For example, this is to allow a firm’stail behavior to be connected with a weighted aggregation of the simultaneousreturns of the other firms. In addition, we control for the common factoreffects. The instrumental variable quantile regressive method is used for ourmodel estimation, and the associated asymptotic theory for estimation is alsoprovided. Simulation results show that our model performs well at variousquantile levels with different network structures, especially when the node sizeincreases. Finally, we illustrate our method with an empirical study. We uncoversignificant network effects in the spatial lag among financial institutions.Keywords:Network, Quantile autoregression, Instrumental variables, Dynamic models
