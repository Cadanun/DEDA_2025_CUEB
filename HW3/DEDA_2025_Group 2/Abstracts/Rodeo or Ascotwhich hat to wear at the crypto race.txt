Abstract:This paper sheds light on the dynamics of the cryptocurrency (CC) sector. Bymodeling its dynamics via a stochastic volatility with correlated jumps (SVCJ)model in combination with several rolling windows, it is possible to capture theextreme ups and downs of the CC market and to understand its dynamics. Throughthis approach, we obtain time series for each parameter of the model. Eventhough parameter estimates change over time and depend on the window size,several recurring patterns are observable which are robust to changes of thewindow size and supported by clustering of parameter estimates: during bullishperiods, volatility stabilizes at low levels and the size and volatility ofjumps in mean decreases. In bearish periods though, volatility increases andtakes longer to return to its long-run trend. Furthermore, jumps in mean andjumps in volatility are independent. With the rise of the CC market in 2017, alevel shift of the volatility of volatility occurred.Keywords:Cryptocurrency, SVCJ, Market Dynamics, Stochastic Volatility
