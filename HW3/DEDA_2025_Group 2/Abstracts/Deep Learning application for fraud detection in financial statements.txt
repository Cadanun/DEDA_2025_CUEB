Abstract:Financial statement fraud is an area of significant consternation for potentialinvestors, auditing companies, and state regulators. Intelligent systemsfacilitate detecting financial statement fraud and assist the decision-making ofrelevant stakeholders. Previous research detected instances in which financialstatements have been fraudulently misrepresented in managerial comments. Thepaper aims to investigate whether it is possible to develop an enhanced systemfor detecting financial fraud through the combination of information sourcedfrom financial ratios and managerial comments within corporate annual reports.We employ a hierarchical attention network (HAN) with a long short-term memory(LSTM) encoder to extract text features from the Management Discussion andAnalysis (MD&A) section of annual reports. The model is designed to offer twodistinct features. First, it reflects the structured hierarchy of documents,which previous models were unable to capture. Second, the model embodies twodifferent attention mechanisms at the word and sentence level, which allowscontent to be differentiated in terms of its importance in the process ofconstructing the document representation. As a result of its architecture, themodel captures both content and context of managerial comments, which serve assupplementary predictors to financial ratios in the detection of fraudulentreporting. Additionally, the model provides interpretable indicators denoted as“red-flag” sentences, which assist stakeholders in their process of determiningwhether further investigation of a specific annual report is required. Empiricalresults demonstrate that textual features of MD&A sections extracted by HANyield promising classification results and substantially reinforce financialratios.Keywords:fraud detection, financial statements, deep learning, text analytics
