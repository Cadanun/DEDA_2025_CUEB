Abstract:In this paper, we study estimation of nonlinear models with cross sectional datausing two-step generalized estimating equations (GEE) in the quasi-maximumlikelihood estimation (QMLE) framework. In the interest of improving efficiency,we propose a grouping estimator to account for the potential spatial correlationin the underlying innovations. We use a Poisson model and a Negative Binomial IImodel for count data and a Probit model for binary response data to demonstratethe GEE procedure. Under mild weak dependency assumptions, results on estimationconsistency and asymptotic normality are provided. Monte Carlo simulations showefficiency gain of our approach in comparison of different estimation methodsfor count data and binary response data. Finally we apply the GEE approach tostudy the determinants of the inflow foreign direct investment (FDI) to China.Keywords:quasi-maximum likelihood estimation; generalized estimating equations; nonlinearmodels; spatial dependence; count data; binary response data; FDI equation
