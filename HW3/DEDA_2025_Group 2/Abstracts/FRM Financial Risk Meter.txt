Abstract:A daily systemic risk measure is proposed accounting for links and mutualdependencies between financial institutions utilising tail event information. FRM(Financial Risk Meter) is based on Lasso quantile regression designed to capturetail event co-movements. The FRM focus lies on understanding active set datacharacteristics and the presentation of interdependencies in a network topology.Two FRM indices are presented, namely, FRM@Americas and FRM@Europe. The FRMindices detect systemic risk at selected areas and identifies risk factors. Inpractice, FRM is applied to the return time series of selected financialinstitutions and macroeconomic risk factors. Using FRM on a daily basis, weidentify companies exhibiting extreme "co-stress", as well as "activators" ofstress. With the SRM@EuroArea, we extend to the government bond asset class. FRMis a good predictor for recession probabilities, constituting the FRM-impliedrecession probabilities. Thereby, FRM indicates tail event behaviour in anetwork of financial risk factors.Keywords:Systemic Risk, Quantile Regression, Financial Markets, Risk Management, NetworkDynamics, Recession
