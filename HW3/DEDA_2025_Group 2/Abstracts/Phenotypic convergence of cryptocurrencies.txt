Abstract:The aim of this paper is to prove the phenotypic convergence ofcryptocurrencies, in the sense that individual cryptocurrencies respond tosimilar selection pressures by developing similar characteristics. In order toretrieve the cryptocurrencies phenotype, we treat cryptocurrencies as financialinstruments (genus proximum) and find their specific difference (differentia specifica) by using the daily time series of log-returns. In this sense, a daily timeseries of asset returns (either cryptocurrencies or classical assets) can becharacterized by a multidimensional vector with statistical components likevolatility, skewness, kurtosis, tail probability, quantiles, conditional tailexpectation or fractal dimension. By using dimension reduction techniques(Factor Analysis) and classification models (Binary Logistic Regression,Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines, K-means clustering, VarianceComponents Split methods) for a representative sample of cryptocurrencies,stocks, exchange rates and commodities, we are able to classify cryptocurrenciesas a new asset class with unique features in the tails of the log-returnsdistribution. The main result of our paper is the complete separation of thecryptocurrencies from the other type of assets, by using the Maximum VarianceComponents Split method. More, we observe a divergent evolution of thecryptocurrencies species, compared to the classical assets, mainly due to thetails behaviour of the log-returns distribution.
