Abstract:Inflation expectation (IE) is often considered to be an important determinant ofactual inflation in modern economic theory, we are interested in investigatingthe main risk factors that determine its dynamics. We fiirst apply a jointarbitrage-free term structure model across different European countries toobtain estimate for country-specific IE. Then we use the two-component andthree-component models to capture the main risk factors. We discover that theextracted common trend for IE is an important driver for each country ofinterest. Moreover a spatial-temporal copula model is  tted to account for thenon-Gaussian dependency across countries. This paper aims to extract informativeestimates for IE and provide good implications for monetary policies.Keywords:in ation expectation; joint yield-curve modeling; factor model; common trend;spatial-temporal copulas
