Abstract:The paper estimates banks’ total factor efficiency (TFE) as well as TFE of eachproduction factor by incorporating banks’ overall risk endogenously into bank’sproduction process as undesirable by-product in a Global-SMB Model. Our resultsshow that, compared with a model incorporated with banks’ overall risk, a modelconsidering only on-balance-sheet risk may over-estimate the integrated TFE(TFIE) and under-estimate TFE volatility. Significant heterogeneities of bankTFIE and TFE of each production factor exist among banks of different types andregions, as a result of still prominent unbalanced development of Chinesecommercial banks. Based on the estimated TFIE, the paper further investigatesthe determinants of bank efficiency, and finds that shadow banking, bank size,NPL ratio, loan to deposit ratio, fiscal surplus to GDP ratio and banking sectorconcentration are significant determinants of bank efficiency. Besides, a modelwith risk-weighted assets as undesirable outputs can better capture the impactof shadow banking involvement.Keywords:Nonparametric Methods, Commercial Banks, Shadow Bank, Financial Risk
