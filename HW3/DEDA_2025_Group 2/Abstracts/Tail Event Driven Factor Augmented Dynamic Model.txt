Abstract:A factor augmented dynamic model for analysing tail behaviour of highdimensional time series is proposed. As a first step, the tail event drivenlatent factors are extracted. In the second step, a VAR (Vectorautoregressionmodel) is carried out to analyse the interaction between these factors and themacroeconomic variables. Furthermore, this methodology also provides thepossibility for central banks to examine the sensitivity between macroeconomicvariables and financial shocks via impulse response analysis. Then thepredictability of our estimator is illustrated. Finally, forecast error variancedecomposition is carried out to investigate the network effect of thesevariables. The interesting findings are: firstly, GDP and Unemployment rate arevery much sensitive to the shock of financial tail event driven factors, whilethese factors are more affected by inflation and short term interest rate.Secondly, financial tail event driven factors play important roles in thenetwork constructed by the extracted factors and the macroeconomic variables.Thirdly, there is more connectedness during financial crisis than in the stableperiods. Compared with median case, the network is more dense in lower quantilelevel.Keywords:Quantile Regression, Expectile Regression, Dynamic Factor Model, Dynamic Network
