A Financial Risk Meter for China Ruting WangMichael AlthofWolfgang Karl Härdle Abstract:This paper develops a new risk meter specifically for China – FRM@China – todetect systemic financial risk as well as tail-event (TE) dependencies amongmajor financial institutions (FIs). Compared with the CBOE FIX VIX, which iscurrently the most popular financial risk measure, FRM@China has less noise. Italso emitted a risk signature much earlier than the CBOE FIX VIX index in th20 COVID pandemic. In addition, FRM@China uses a single quantile-lassoregression model to allow both the assessment of risk transfer between differentsectors in which FIs operate and the prediction of systemic risk. Because therisk indicator in FRM@China is based on penalization terms, its relationshipwith macro variables are unknown and non-linear. This paper further expands theexisting FRM approach by using Shapley values to identify the dynamiccontribution of different macro features in this type of "black box" situation.The results show that short-term interest rates and forward guidance aresignificant risk drivers. This paper considers the interaction among FIs frommainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan to provide an enhanced regional tool setfor regulators to evaluate financial policy responses. All quantlets areavailable on quantlet.com. Keywords:FRM (Financial Risk Meter), Lasso Quantile Regression, Financial Network, China,Shapley value
