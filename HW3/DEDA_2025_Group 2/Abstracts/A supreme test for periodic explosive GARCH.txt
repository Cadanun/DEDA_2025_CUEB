Abstract:We develop a uniform test for detecting and dating explosive behavior of astrictly stationary GARCH(r, s) (generalized autoregressive conditionalheteroskedasticity) process. Namely, we test the null hypothesis of a globallystable GARCH process with constant parameters against an alternative where thereis an ’abnormal’ period with changed parameter values. During this period, thechange may lead to an explosive behavior of the volatility process. It isassumed that both the magnitude and the timing of the breaks are unknown. Wedevelop a double supreme test for the existence of a break, and then provide analgorithm to identify the period of change. Our theoretical results hold undermild moment assumptions on the innovations of the GARCH process. Technically,the existing properties for the QMLE in the GARCH model need to bereinvestigated to hold uniformly over all possible periods of change. The keyresults involve a uniform weak Bahadur representation for the estimatedparameters, which leads to weak convergence of the test statistic to the supremeof a Gaussian Process. In simulations we show that the test has good size andpower for reasonably large time series lengths. We apply the test to Apple assetreturns and Bitcoin returns.Keywords:GARCH, IGARCH, Change-point Analysis, Concentration Inequalities, Uniform Test
