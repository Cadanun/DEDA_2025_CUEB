Abstract In this paper, the complete convergence and complete moment convergence for maximal weighted sums of extended negatively dependent random variables are investigated. Some suÂ±cient conditions for the convergence are provided. In addition, the Marcinkiewicz{Zygmund type strong law of large numbers for weighted sums of extended negatively dependent random variables is obtained. The results obtained in the article extend the corresponding ones for independent random variables and some dependent random variables.  Keywords:  Extended negatively dependent, complete convergence, complete moment convergence, maximal weighted sums, strong law of large numbers
