Abstract:Among all the emerging markets, the cryptocurrency market is considered the mostcontroversial and simultaneously the most interesting one. The visiblysignificant market capitalization of cryptos motivates modern financialinstruments such as futures and options. Those will depend on the dynamics,volatility, or even the jumps of cryptos. In this paper, the riskcharacteristics for Bitcoin are analyzed from a realized volatility dynamicsview. The realized variance RV is estimated with (threshold-)jump components(T)J, semivariance RSV+(−) , and signed jumps (T)J+(−) . Our empirical resultsshow that the Bitcoin market is far riskier than any other developed financialmarket. Up to 68% of the sample days are identified to entangle jumps. However,the discontinuities do not contribute to the variance significantly. Byemploying a 90-day rolling-window method, the in-sample evidence suggests thatthe impacts of predictors change over time systematically under HAR-type models.The out-of-sample forecasting results reveal that the forecasting horizonplays an important role in choosing forecasting models. For long-horizon riskforecast, a finer model calibrated with jumps gives extra utility up to 20 basispoints annually, while an approach based on the roughest estimators suits theshort-horizon risk forecast best. Last but not least, a simple equal-weightedportfolio not only significantly reduces the size and quantity of jumps but alsogives investors higher utility in short-horizon risk forecast case.Keywords:Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Realized Variance, Thresholded Jump, Signed Jumps,Realized Utility
