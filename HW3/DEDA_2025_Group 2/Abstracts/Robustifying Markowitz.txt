Abstract:Markowitz mean-variance portfolios with sample mean and covariance as inputparameters feature numerous issues in practice. They perform poorly out ofsample due to estimation error, they experience extreme weights together withhigh sensitivity to change in input parameters. The heavy-tail characteristicsof â€€financial time series are in fact the cause for these erratic fluctuationsof weights that consequently create substantial transaction costs. Inrobustifying the weights we present a toolbox for stabilizing costs and weightsfor global minimum Markowitz portfolios. Utilizing a projected gradient descent(PGD) technique, we avoid the estimation and inversion of the covarianceoperator as a whole and concentrate on robust estimation of the gradient descentincrement. Using modern tools of robust statistics we construct acomputationally efficient estimator with almost Gaussian properties based onmedian-of-means uniformly over weights. This robustified Markowitz approach isconfirmed by empirical studies on equity markets. We demonstrate thatrobustified portfolios reach higher risk-adjusted performance and the lowestturnover compared to shrinkage based and constrained portfolios.Keywords:.
