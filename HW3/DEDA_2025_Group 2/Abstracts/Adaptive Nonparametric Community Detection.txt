Abstract:Understanding the topological structure of real world networks is of hugeinterest in a variety of fields. One of the way to investigate this structure isto find the groups of densely connected nodes called communities. This paperpresents a new non-parametric method of community detection in networks calledAdaptive Weights Community Detection. The idea of the algorithm is to associatea local community for each node. On every iteration the algorithm tests ahypothesis that two nodes are in the same community by comparing their localcommunities. The test rejects the hypothesis if the density of edges betweenthese two local communities is lower than the density inside each one. Adetailed performance analysis of the method shows its dominance over state-of-the-art methods on well known artificial and real world benchmarks.Keywords:Adaptive weights, Gap coefficient, Graph clustering, Nonparametric, Overlappingcommunities
