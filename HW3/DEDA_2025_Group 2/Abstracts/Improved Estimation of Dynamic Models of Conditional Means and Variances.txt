Abstract:Modelling dynamic conditional heteroscedasticity is the daily routine in timeseries econometrics. We propose a weighted conditional moment estimation topotentially improve the eciency of the QMLE (quasi maximum likelihoodestimation). The weights of conditional moments are selected based on theanalytical form of optimal instruments, and we nominally decide the optimalinstrument based on the third and fourth moments of the underlying error term.This approach is motivated by the idea of general estimation equations (GEE). Wealso provide an analysis of the eciency of QMLE for the location and varianceparameters. Simulations and applications are conducted to show the betterperformance of our estimators.Keywords:-
