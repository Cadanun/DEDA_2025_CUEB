Abstract:This study provides a formal analysis of the customer targeting decision problemin settings where the cost for marketing action is stochastic and proposes aframework to efficiently estimate the decision variables for campaign profitoptimization. Targeting a customer is profitable if the positive impact of themarketing treatment on the customer and the associated profit to the company ishigher than the cost of the treatment. While there is a growing literature ondeveloping causal or uplift models to identify the customers who are impactedmost strongly by the marketing action, no research has investigated optimaltargeting when the costs of the action are uncertain at the time of thetargeting decision. Because marketing incentives are routinely conditioned on apositive response by the customer, e.g. a purchase or contract renewal,stochastic costs are ubiquitous in direct marketing and customer retentioncampaigns. This study makes two contributions to the literature, which areevaluated on a coupon targeting campaign in an e-commerce setting. First, theauthors formally analyze the targeting decision problem under response-dependentcosts. Profit-optimal targeting requires an estimate of the treatment effect onthe customer and an estimate of the customer response probability undertreatment. The empirical results demonstrate that the consideration of treatmentcost substantially increases campaign profit when used for customer targeting incombination with the estimation of the average or customer- level treatmenteffect. Second, the authors propose a framework to jointly estimate thetreatment effect and the response probability combining methods for causalinference with a hurdle mixture model. The proposed causal hurdle model achievescompetitive campaign profit while streamlining model building. The code for theempirical analysis is available on Github.Keywords:Heterogeneous Treatment Effect, Uplift Modeling, Coupon Targeting,Churn/Retention, Campaign Profit
