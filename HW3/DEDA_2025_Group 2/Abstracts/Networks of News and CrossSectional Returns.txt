Networks of News and Cross-Sectional Returns Junjie HuWolfgang Karl HÃ¤rdle Abstract:We uncover networks from news articles to study cross-sectional stock returns.By analyzing a huge dataset of more than 1 million news articles collected fromthe internet, we construct time-varying directed networks of the S&0 stocks.The well-defined directed news networks are formed based on a modest assumptionabout firm-specific news structure, and we propose an algorithm to tackle type-Ierrors in identifying the stock tickers. We find strong evidence for thecomovement effect between the news-linked stocks returns and reversal effectfrom the lead stock return on the 1-day ahead follower stock return, aftercontrolling for many known effects. Furthermore, a series of portfolio testsreveal that the news network attention proxy, network degree, provides a robustand significant cross-sectional predictability of the monthly stock returns.Among different types of news linkages, the linkages of within-sector stocks,large size lead firms, and lead firms with lower stock liquidity are crucial forcross-sectional predictability.
