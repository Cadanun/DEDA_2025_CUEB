Abstract:The cryptocurrency market is unique on many levels: Very volatile, frequentlychanging market structure, emerging and vanishing of cryptocurrencies on a dailylevel. Following its development became a difficult task with the success ofcryptocurrencies (CCs) other than Bitcoin. For fiat currency markets, the IMFoffers the index SDR and, prior to the EUR, the ECU existed, which was an indexrepresenting the development of European currencies. Index providers decide on afixed number of index constituents which will represent the market segment. Itis a challenge to fix a number and develop rules for the constituents in view ofthe market changes. In the frequently changing CC market, this challenge is evenmore severe. A method relying on the AIC is proposed to quickly react to marketchanges and therefore enable us to create an index, referred to as CRIX, for thecryptocurrency market. CRIX is chosen by model selection such that it representsthe market well to enable each interested party studying economic questions inthis market and to invest into the market. The diversified nature of the CCmarket makes the inclusion of altcoins in the index product critical to improvetracking performance. We have shown that assigning optimal weights to altcoinshelps to reduce the tracking errors of a CC portfolio, despite the fact thattheir market cap is much smaller relative to Bitcoin.
