Abstract:Customer scoring models are the core of scalable direct marketing. Uplift modelsprovide an estimate of the incremental benefit from a treatment that is used foroperational decision-making. Training and monitoring of uplift models requireexperimental data. However, the collection of data under randomized treatmentassignment is costly, since random targeting deviates from an establishedtargeting policy. To increase the cost-efficiency of experimentation andfacilitate frequent data collection and model training, we introduce supervisedrandomization. It is a novel approach that integrates existing scoring modelsinto randomized trials to target relevant customers, while ensuring consistentestimates of treatment effects through correction for active sample selection.An empirical Monte Carlo study shows that data collection under supervisedrandomization is cost-efficient, while downstream uplift models performcompetitively.Keywords:Uplift Modeling, Causal Inference, Experimental Design, Selection Bias
