Abstract:In this paper, we develop an multi period overlapping generation framework toinvestigate agents' consumption and saving decisions, inequality and welfareamong elderly. We assume that agents are heterogeneous in the non-asset incomeand the medical expenditure. In order to explicitly analyze the e ects ofmedical expenditure, we conduct three counterfactual exercises. We successivelyshut down the heterogeneity in labor income, in the level and in the dispersionof medical expenses respectively. By comparing the benchmark with thecounterfactual results, we  nd that in general wealth inequality decreases withage, and income uncertainty contributes the most to wealth inequality. Bothaverage consumption and consumption inequality increase with age. Consumptioninequality largely tracks income inequality. Though uncertainty in medicalexpenditures has little e ect on consumption inequality, a higher level ofmedical expenditures may exacerbate consumption inequality. Meanwhile, theaverage saving of elderly exhibits an inverse-U shape with age. The impacts onaverage saving are similar both in benchmark and in counterfactual exercises.Welfare increases with age.Keywords:Income Inequality, Social Mobility, Price-to-rent ratio
