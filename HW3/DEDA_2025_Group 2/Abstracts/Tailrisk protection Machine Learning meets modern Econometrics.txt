Abstract:Tail risk protection is in the focus of the financial industry and requiressolid mathematical and statistical tools, especially when a trading strategy isderived. Recent hype driven by machine learning (ML) mechanisms has raised thenecessity to display and understand the functionality of ML tools. In thispaper, we present a dynamic tail risk protection strategy that targets a maximumpredefined level of risk measured by Value-At-Risk while controlling forparticipation in bull market regimes. We propose different weak classifiers,parametric and non-parametric, that estimate the exceedance probability of therisk level from which we derive trading signals in order to hedge tail events.We then compare the different approaches both with statistical and tradingstrategy performance, finally we propose an ensemble classifier that produces ameta tail risk protection strategy improving both generalization and tradingperformance.Keywords:-
