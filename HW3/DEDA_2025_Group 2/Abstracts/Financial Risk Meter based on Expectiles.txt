Abstract:The Financial Risk Meter (FRM) is an established mechanism that, based onconditional Value at Risk (VaR) ideas, yields insight into the dynamics ofnetwork risk. Originally, the FRM has been composed via Lasso based quantileregression, but we here extend it by incorporating the idea of expectiles, thusindicating not only the tail probability but rather the actual tail loss given astress situation in the network. The expectile variant of the FRM enjoys severaladvantages: Firstly, the coherent and multivariate tail risk indicatorconditional expectile-based VaR (CoEVaR) can be derived, which is sensitive tothe magnitude of extreme losses. Next, FRM index is not restricted to an indexcompared to the quantile based FRM mechanisms, but can be expanded to a set ofsystemic tail risk indicators, which provide investors with numerous tools interms of diverse risk preferences. The power of FRM also lies in displaying FRMdistribution across various entities every day. Two distinct patterns can bediscovered under high stress and during stable periods from the empiricalresults in the United States stock market. Furthermore, the framework is able toidentify individual risk characteristics and capture spillover effects in anetwork.Keywords:expectiles, EVaR, CoEVaR, expectile lasso regression, network analysis, systemicrisk, Financial Risk Meter
