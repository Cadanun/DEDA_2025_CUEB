Abstract:Excessive house price growth was at the heart of the financial crisis i07/08. Since then, many countries have added cooling measures to theirregulatory frameworks. It has been found that these measures can indeed controlprice growth, but no one has examined whether this has adverse consequences forthe housing wealth distribution. We examine this for Singapore, which started i09 to target price growth over ten rounds in total. We find that welfare fromhousing wealth in the last round might not be higher than before 2009. Thisdepends on the deflator used to convert nominal into real prices. Irrespectiveof the deflator, we can reject that welfare increased monotonically over thedifferent rounds.Keywords:house price distribution, stochastic dominance tests
