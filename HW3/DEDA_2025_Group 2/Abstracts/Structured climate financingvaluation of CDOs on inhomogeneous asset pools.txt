Abstract:Recently, a number of structured funds have emerged as public-privatepartnerships with the intent of promoting investment in renewable energy inemerging markets. These funds seek to attract institutional investors bytranching the asset pool and issuing senior notes with a high credit quality.Financing of renewable energy (RE) projects is achieved via two channels: smallRE projects are financed indirectly through local banks that draw loans from thefundâ€™s assets, whereas large RE projects are directly financed from the fund. Ina bottom-up Gaussian copula framework, we examine the diversification propertiesand RE exposure of the senior tranche. To this end, we introduce the LH++ model,which combines a homogeneous infinitely granular loan portfolio with a finitenumber of large loans. Using expected tranche percentage notional (which takes asimilar role as the default probability of a loan), tranche prices and tranchesensitivities in RE loans, we analyse the risk profile of the senior tranche. Weshow how the mix of indirect and direct RE investments in the asset pool affectsthe sensitivity of the senior tranche to RE investments and how to balance adesired sensitivity with a target credit quality and target tranche size.Keywords:Renewable energy financing, structured finance, CDO pricing, LH++ model
