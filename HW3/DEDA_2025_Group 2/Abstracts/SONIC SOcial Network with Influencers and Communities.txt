Abstract:The integration of social media characteristics into an econometric frameworkrequires modeling a high dimensional dynamic network with dimensions ofparameter Θ typically much larger than the number of observations. To cope withthis problem, we introduce a new structural model — SONIC which assumes that(1) a few influencers drive the network dynamics; (2) the community structure ofthe network is characterized as the homogeneity of response to the specificinfluencer, implying their underlying similarity. An estimation procedure isproposed based on a greedy algorithm and LASSO regularization. Throughtheoretical study and simulations, we show that the matrix parameter can beestimated even when the observed time interval is smaller than the size of thenetwork. Using a novel dataset retrieved from a leading social media platform–StockTwits and quantifying their opinions via natural language processing, wemodel the opinions network dynamics among a select group of users and furtherdetect the latent communities. With a sparsity regularization, we can identifyimportant nodes in the network.Keywords:social media, network, community, opinion mining, natural language processing
