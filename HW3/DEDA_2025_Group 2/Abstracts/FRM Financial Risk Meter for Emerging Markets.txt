Abstract:The fast-growing Emerging Market (EM) economies and their improved transparencyand liquidity have attracted international investors. However, the externalprice shocks can result in a higher level of volatility as well as domesticpolicy instability. Therefore, an efficient risk measure and hedging strategiesare needed to help investors protect their investments against this risk. Inthis paper, a daily systemic risk measure, called FRM (Financial Risk Meter) isproposed. The FRM@ EM is applied to capture systemic risk behavior embedded inthe returns of the 25 largest EMs’ FIs, covering the BRIMST (Brazil, Russia,India, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey), and thereby reflects the financiallinkages between these economies. Concerning the Macro factors, in addition tothe Adrian & Brunnermeier (2016) Macro, we include the EM sovereign yield spreadover respective US Treasuries and the above-mentioned countries’ currencies. Theresults indicated that the FRM of EMs’ FIs reached its maximum during the USfinancial crisis following by COVID 19 crisis and the Macro factors explain theBRIMST’ FIs with various degrees of sensibility. We then study the relationshipbetween those factors and the tail event network behavior to build our policyrecommendations to help the investors to choose the suitable market forinvestment and tail-event optimized portfolios. For that purpose, an overlappingregion between portfolio optimization strategies and FRM network centrality isdeveloped. We propose a robust and well-diversified tail-event and cluster risk-sensitive portfolio allocation model and compare it to more classicalapproaches.Keywords:FRM (Financial Risk Meter), Lasso Quantile Regression, Network Dynamics,Emerging Markets, Hierarchical Risk Parity
