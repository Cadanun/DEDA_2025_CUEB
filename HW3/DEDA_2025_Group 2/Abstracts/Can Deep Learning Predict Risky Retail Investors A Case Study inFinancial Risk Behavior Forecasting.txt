Abstract:The paper examines the potential of deep learning to produce decision supportmodels from structured, tabular data. Considering the context of financial riskmanagement, we develop a deep learning model for predicting whether individualspread traders are likely to secure profits from future trades. This embodiestypical modeling challenges faced in risk and behavior forecasting. Conventionalmachine learning requires data that is representative of the feature-targetrelationship and relies on the often costly development, maintenance, andrevision of handcrafted features. Consequently, modeling highly variable,heterogeneous patterns such as the behavior of traders is challenging. Deeplearning promises a remedy. Learning hierarchical distributed representations ofthe raw data in an automatic manner (e.g. risk taking behavior), it uncoversgenerative features that determine the target (e.g., traderâ€™s profitability),avoids manual feature engineering, and is more robust toward change (e.g.dynamic market conditions). The results of employing a deep network foroperational risk forecasting confirm the feature learning capability of deeplearning, provide guidance on designing a suitable network architecture anddemonstrate the superiority of deep learning over machine learning and rule-based benchmarks.Keywords:risk management, retail finance, forecasting, deep learning
