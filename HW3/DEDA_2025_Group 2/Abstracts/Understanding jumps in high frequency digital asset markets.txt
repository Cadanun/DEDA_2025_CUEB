Abstract:While attention is a predictor for digital asset prices, and jumps in Bitcoinprices are well-known, we know little about its alternatives. Studying highfrequency crypto data gives us the unique possibility to confirm that crossmarket digital asset returns are driven by high frequency jumps clustered aroundblack swan events, resembling volatility and trading volume seasonalities.Regressions show that intra-day jumps significantly influence end of day returnsin size and direction. This provides fundamental research for crypto optionpricing models. However, we need better econometric methods for capturing thespecific market microstructure of cryptos. All calculations are reproducible viathe quantlet.com technology.Keywords:jumps, market microstructure noise, high frequency data, cryptocurrencies, CRIX,option pricing
