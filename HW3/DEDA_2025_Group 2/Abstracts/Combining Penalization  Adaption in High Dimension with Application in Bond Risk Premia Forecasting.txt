Abstract:The predictability of a high-dimensional time series model in forecasting withlarge information sets depends not only on the stability of parameters but alsodepends heavily on the active covariates in the model. Since the true empiricalenvironment can change as time goes by, the variables that function well at thepresent may become useless in the future. Combined with the instable parameters,finding the most active covariates in the parameter time-varying situationsbecomes difficult. In this paper, we aim to propose a new method, the PenalizedAdaptive Method (PAM), which can adaptively detect the parameter homogeneousintervals and simultaneously select the active variables in sparse models. Thenewly developed method is able to identify the parameters stability at one handand meanwhile, at the other hand, can manage of selecting the active forecastingcovariates at every different time point. Comparing with the classical models,the method can be applied to high-dimensional cases with different sources ofparameter changes while it steadily reduces the forecast error in high-dimensional data. In the out-of-sample bond risk premia forecasting, thePenalized Adaptive Method can reduce the forecasting error(RMSPE and MAPE)around 24% to 50% comparing with the other forecasting methods.Keywords:SCAD penalty, propagation-separation, adaptive window choice, multiplierbootstrap, bond risk premia
